# S1.07.Testing
## üìÑDescription
Nivel 1
Task 1. Given the NumberChecker class, program the unit tests needed to certify that the class's source code does what it has to do.

Task 2. Let's practice some TDD. Remember exercise 5 of the Basic PHP level and think about tests that you could perform to test their correct functioning. Schedule them and then carry out the program to test step by step as you validate the previously created tests.
